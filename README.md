##### Challenges :

Sorry for the bad readme.

For this assignment I feel like my challenge this weekend was time. And figuring out where everything went wrong on Friday. 

I mean at this point Ravens are like writing desks to me. 

Tried to add the new comment on the tech show page with this :

~~~
  <%= form_with url:[@tech, @comment], local: true, class: "nifty_form" do |f| %>
  <%= f.number_field :user_id, :type => 'hidden', value: current_user.id%>
  <%= f.number_field :tech_id, :type => 'hidden', value: @tech.id%>
  <%= f.text_area :body, size: "60x3" %>
  <%= f.submit "Post" %>
<% end %>
~~~

But it go to a point where it was creating new tech pages instead of comments.

Other than that I had some issues with the seedfile but it was because the images were labeled wrong.

##### Take-Aways :

I'm pretty happy with my progress. Wasn't as happy with my time management this weekend but I'm happy that I understand the logicless logic.

I give it a 5/10, could do better.
